# Create a new Git repo in your project 

Azure DevOps Services contain Git repositories, work items, builds, and releases. You can use Git repos in your projects to manage your source code, particularly as your project grows. 
This document will detail how to create a Git repo using the web portal for Azure DevOps Services.

## Prerequisites
* An organization in Azure DevOps. If you don't have one, you can sign up for one for free. Each organization includes free, unlimited private Git repositories.
* Git command-line tools:
  * Install Git for Windows, which includes Git Credential Manager Core
  * Install Git for macOS and Linux.
    * For macOS and Linux, we recommend configuring SSH authentication
* A project in Azure DevOps as detailed [here](https://github.com/felicity-borg/Microsoft-TDSP/blob/master/Docs/agile-development.md).
# Create a repo using the web portal
1. Navigate to the **Repos** page in your project, hover your mouse over the name of your project and select the **Repos** icon.
