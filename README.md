# Documentation to help you learn data science tools and help you execute a data science project in a systematic, version controlled, and collaborative way.

How to use the Team Data Science Processs, an agile iterative data science metholdology for predictive analytics solutions and intelligent applications. 
If you would like to set up the tools and frameworks for a larger project where a number of people will be contributing pages refer to **Roles and Tasks** followed by **Development** below. 

If you would like instructions on how to get started on a small project such as a Proof of Concept or you would like to develop some exerience using Azure DevOps, Azure ML and an IDE or text editor refer to pages in **Getting Started**.

**Getting Started** contains two options for code development: 
 * **Visual Studio Code**: VS Code is a fully featured text editor which includes debugging tools and other advanced features and extensions that improve code quality and      producitvity when programming.
 * **Jupyter Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks are useful for setting global variables and diplaying outputs in the same place as code e.g. when writing reports and when code is not to be re-used. 

Both can be used together to their strengths, e.g. complex code is writen as a module (e.g. Python file containing class and function definitions) in VS code, and called from the jupyter notebook to set variables and display results.
